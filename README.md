# Java_SpringBoot
SpringBoot projects from my time at bootcamp.

Many of these assignments are only partially completed; the month of bootcamp where I 
  was dealing with Java, I struggled with the core concepts until near the end. That said,
  I've completed Show Reviewer, which was the exam.

Tapper is a much lengthier Java project that incorporates much of what's loaded into this folder, as well as new material.
